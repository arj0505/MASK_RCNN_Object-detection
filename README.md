# MASK_RCNN_Object-detection

Developed deeplearning Mask_RCNN object detection project to masking satilight images like Buildings,Forest and Rivers.
for this project i took very small dataset like 50 images done with labeling. One thing to remember for labelling mask rcnn is deferent than 
other object detection. here we are using labelme tool to labeling the images.

For Mask_RCNN i took pretrained model like SSD_MobileNet_V1 from TFOD Zoo model and to trained my model in paper space for 20000 epochs.
it took around 3hrs to train my model.
